The reason for this is because tying a component to the Redux store couples it to a particular slice of the state of your application, as well as coupling it to a particular way of organizing your state. So refactoring a lot of container components can be difficult. Debugging can also be difficult with a lot of container components, because they interrupt the usual flow of data down through components.

It can be painful to pass lots of props all the way down to the leaf components in a component tree and container components allow you to "reset" and grab specific data from the store without all that wiring.
