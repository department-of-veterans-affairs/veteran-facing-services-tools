# HTTP Headers used on VA.gov


---
## Overview

- HTTP headers control browser behavior
- Browser behavior is a front end concern
- Shared responsibility between devops and front end
  - configuration
  - management
  - user experience
- Typically
  - devops responsible for the how (e.g. Terraform)
  - front end responsible for the why (e.g. security, caching behavior)
---
## HTTP Example
- raw request and response

---
## HTTP Request Example
- `GET /health-care/ HTTP/1.1`
  - action to perform, resource location, http version
  - `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`
- `Host: www.va.gov` - derived from URI
- `Connection: keep-alive`
  - HTTP persistent connection
  - reduces latency and traffic by reusing TCP connection
- `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1`
  - supports `Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests`
  - basically tells server to redirect http requests to https
- `User-Agent: ...` - identifying information about client software e.g. OS, version
---
## HTTP Request Example continued

- `Accepts: ...`
  - MIME types supported
  - Server chooses one as the `Content-Type` on the response
- `Accept-Encoding: gzip, defat, br` - supported compression algorithms
- `Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9`
  - supported language and localization preference
  - `q=0.9` expresses order of preference

## HTTP Response Example


---
## Content Security Protocol and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CSP and CORS)

- HTML describes initial structure and resources required for an application to run
- HTTP describes the request-response layer of the application
- HTTP wraps the resources in meta data

    end
```
- Easiest way to see http headers is by using chrome dev tools
- HTTP headers are extensible
- Review headers and what they do - most of these you can google to figure out what they do. Weâ€™ll quickly cover all of them but Iâ€™m going to primarily focus on the ones that impact downloading and caching behavior
	- briefly talk about header types
		- request / response header
		- General headers
		- Entity header
		- Proxy handling
			- end-to-end
			- Hop-by-hop
	- x-amz-is-2 - used by amazon to troubleshoot stuff: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonResponseHeaders.html
	- X-XSS-Protection - weâ€™ll dive into this when we talk about content security protocol
	- Transfer-Encoding - hop-by-hop header- chunked directive indicates that data is sent in a series of chunks and that the content-length is replaced by length of each chunk
	- Content-type - entity header indicates the media type of the resource , browser will ignore and sniff MIME type; MIME type; determines how the client handles the resource
	- X-Frame-Options - prevents clickjacking attacks - eBay story
	- HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) - tells the browser to only connect to website via https
		- max-age, includeSubdomains, preload
	- Set-Cookie- cookie set by the server
	- Referrer-Policy - determines referrer header
	- X-Content-Type-Options: no-sniff - follow the mime-types in the http content-type. Donâ€™t ignore. Realistically only applies to scripts and styles right now
