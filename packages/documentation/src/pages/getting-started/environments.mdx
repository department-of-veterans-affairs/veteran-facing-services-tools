# Environments

| Environment | site url | api url | buildtype | NODE_ENV | Deployments |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------ | --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| localhost | http://localhost:3001 | http://localhost:3000 | localhost | | |
| development | https://dev.va.gov | https://dev-api.va.gov | vagovdev | | After a merge to master |
| staging | https://staging.va.gov | https://staging-api.va.gov | vagovstaging | production | After a merge to master |
| production | https://www.va.gov | https://api.va.gov | vagovprod | production | Daily, Monday - Friday |

There are four environments for va.gov:
- **localhost** runs on a local developer's machine
- **development, staging,** and **production** are shared environments that are accessible publicly.

**production** and **staging** APIs are connected with services within the VA to facilitate testing; **development** API largely uses mock data in lieu of connecting to internal VA services.

## Deployment

- **development, staging,** and **production** have changes to them deployed automatically after pull requests are merged into master.
- Review instances have changes deployed to them automatically when pull requests are created. Review instances are custom environments based on the shared dev environment.

## Access and test users

See [Accessing Staging](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Work%20Practices/Accessing-Staging.md) for

- HTTP basic auth **passwords** needed to access **development** and **staging** environments, and
- **Test users** that can be used to verify features in **localhost**, **development**, and **staging** environments.
