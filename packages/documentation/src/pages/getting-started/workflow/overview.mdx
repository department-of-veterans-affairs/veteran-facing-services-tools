VA.gov uses a [Continuous Integration](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration) process, which consists of the following steps:

1. [Write](/getting-started/workflow/write)
   - Determine which issue to work on
   - Create feature branch
     - branch naming convention \{issue-id}-\{subject you are working on}
   - Code new functionality
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Test new functionality on supported [browsers](/platform/front-end-standards/documented-decisions/browser-support/) (Chrome, IE, Safari, Edge)
2. [Review](/getting-started/workflow/review)
   - Submit pull request
   - Run unit tests and compliance scans (kicked off when a pull request is created)
   - Test feature on review instance (page link is available on the PR page)
   - Test and peer review code (read: code review)
3. [Deploy](/getting-started/workflow/deploy)
   - Merge code to stable code base
   - Jenkins automatically deploys changes merged into `main` to staging and dev
   - Jenkins automatically deploys main to production every day

_Each project's code base has a branch called `main` by default. Anything in `main` is deemed to be stable and deployable. This means that **anything you merge will need to be ready to immediately be live or hidden in some way behind a feature flag**._

Merge changes when support can be provided; Avoid merging significant changes at the end of the day or before the weekend.
