# VA.gov workflow

VA.gov uses a [Continuous Integration](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration) process, which consists of the following steps:

1. [Write](/getting-started/workflow/write)
    - Determine which issue to work on
    - Create feature branch
    - Code new functionality
    - Write tests for new functionality
2. [Review](/getting-started/workflow/review)
    - Submit pull request
    - Run unit tests and compliance scans (kicked off when a pull request is created)
    - Test and peer review code (read: code review)
3. [Deploy](/getting-started/workflow/deploy)
    - Merge code to stable code base

_Each project's code base has a branch called `master` by default. Anything in `master` is deemed to be stable and deployable. This means that **anything you merge will need to be ready to immediately be live or hidden in some way behind a feature flag**._
