These instructions cover building and running VA.gov locally, including configuring any required dependencies.

## Node setup

1. Install `nvm`:

   **Mac:**

   [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is recommended for installing `nvm` but other installation approaches are on [nvm Github page](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation-and-update).

   ```bash
   $ brew update && brew install nvm
   ```

   **Linux:**

   To get the latest version of NVM visit the official page. [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

   ```bash
   $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
   ```

   Follow the post-install instructions in the success message.

2. Install `node 14.15.0` (this also installs `npm`):

   ```bash
   $ nvm install 14.15.0
   ```

3. Configure `nvm` to use `node 14.15.0` by default:

   ```bash
   $ nvm alias default 14.15.0
   ```

4. Install `yarn 1.21.1` globally:

   ```bash
   $ npm i -g yarn@1.21.1
   ```

5. Verify correct versions of `node` and `yarn` are installed:

   ```bash
   $ node --version # 14.15.0
   $ yarn --version # 1.21.1
   ```

## Get the source code

6. Clone VA.gov git repos **as sibling directories**:

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website.git
   $ git clone git@github.com:department-of-veterans-affairs/vagov-content.git
   $ git clone git@github.com:department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build.git
   $ git clone git@github.com:department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema.git
   $ git clone git@github.com:department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools.git
   $ git clone git@github.com:department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api.git
   $ git clone git@github.com:department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-mockdata.git
   ```

   **Front end repos**

   - `vets-website`: Core front end platform and application code
   - `vagov-content`: Markdown content used to generate static pages
   - `content-build`: Liquid templates and content build for static pages
   - `veteran-facing-services-tools`: Shared front end components (including non VA.gov users) and front end documentation site

   **Back end repos**

   - `vets-api`: Core Rails API server application code
   - `vets-api-mockdata`: Mock data used when running locally and on dev for the backend

   **Shared repos**

   - `vets-json-schema`: Shared JSON Schema definitions used by form applications and the APIs that they consume

## Start up the front end

### vets-website

7a. Navigate to the `vets-website` repository, then install `vets-website` dependencies. See these [common commands](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/README.md) for more information.

```bash
$ cd vets-website
$ yarn install
```

8a. Build `vets-website`. If you're only doing application work inside `vets-website` you can run the build command which contains the scaffolding option by default:

```bash
$ yarn build
```

If you need the CSS and JS generated for work in `content-build` you can run a normal build:

```bash
$ yarn build
```

9a. Start the local development server. If you are applying CSS and/or JS changes to a static page/template that renders
in `content-build`, we recommend leaving this command running so you will be able to see the changes in `content-build`.

```bash
$ yarn watch
```

The watch is complete when the CLI says `Compiled successfully`.

If you would like webpack to open a browser window for you, please run `yarn watch --open`. We use [Webpack DevServer](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) to watch and serve the files locally; all the same options and documentation should apply.

10a. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in a browser if you are working on an app;
otherwise, continue on to the [content-build](#content-build) section for viewing changes in the browser.

### content-build

**NOTE:** In order to run `content-build`, you must first generate the CSS and JS files within `vets-website`
(follow steps above). If you don't, you will see a build error in the console instructing you to first
generate files in `vets-website`. If you are applying CSS and/or JS changes to a static page/template that renders
in `content-build` (like the homepage) you will need to run a watch in `vet-website` to view
the updates. The CSS and JS files within `vets-website` are locally connected through a symlink
in the build process.

If you don't need to locally view static pages and are just working on applications, you don't need to set this part up.

7b. Navigate to the `content-build` repository, then install dependencies via `yarn`

```bash
$ cd content-build
$ yarn install
```

8b. Build `content-build`. Make sure you [configured the SOCKS proxy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/internal-tools.md#configure-the-socks-proxy) to fetch content from Drupal.

```bash
$ yarn build
```

If you do not have access to the SOCKS proxy, you can alternately fetch the latest cached version of the content.

```bash
$ yarn fetch-drupal-cache
```

9a. Start the local development server.

```bash
$ yarn watch
```

The watch is complete when the CLI says `Compiled successfully`. If you just need a server running without
watching the metalsmith files you can run `npx http-server . -p 3002` inside `/build/localhost` to
save some CPU.

10a. Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) in a browser

## Backend and internal tools set up

Setting up the backend and internal tools allows local test account login and static content rendering.

- [**Backend (`vets-api`) set up** instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api)

  The local `vets-website` is configured to point to the `vets-api` backend at `http://localhost:3000`. Any website functionality that depends on the backend (i.e. login, save-in-progress, form submission, feature toggles) will require a locally running instance of `vets-api`.

- [**Local test account login** instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Administrative/Accessing-Staging.md)

- [Internal tools setup instructions](internal-tools)

  This proxy setup is required to access static content locally and to access to our reporting and monitoring tools. Running the `yarn watch` task with the SOCKS proxy active will automatically pull and cache the static content for `vets-website`.
