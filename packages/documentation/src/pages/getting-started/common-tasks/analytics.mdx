# Analytics

When creating a new page or new feature there might be a need to add analytics to
capture events on page. In our code base you will find 2 files that relate to analytics.

- /src/platform/startup/analytics-middleware.js
- /src/platform/monitoring/record-event.js

## analytics-middleware.js

This file is a plugin for MetalSmith. This is where the google analytics is
initialized. Events will get pushed to a `window.dataLayer` then evaluated then
sent to our analytics service.

## record-event.js

This file is our utility functions for recording analytical events. You will
want to use these functions for recording events on your page. The `recordEvent`
function will take in an object with an event property like so.

```javascript
recordEvent({
  event: 'your-event-name',
})
```

The event name is determined by your analytics team, so please make sure you
communicate with them to make sure you are using the correct event.
