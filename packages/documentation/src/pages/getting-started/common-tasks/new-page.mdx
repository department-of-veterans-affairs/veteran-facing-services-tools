Note: Check out the [Adding a new feature](/getting-started/common-tasks/new-feature) doc to make sure you're trying to add the right type of feature to VA.gov.

## Choosing vagov-content or Drupal

There are two ways to add a new page to VA.gov; one is by adding it in vagov-content. The other is to add it to the Drupal CMS. Drupal will eventually be the only source of content, but `vagov-content` is expected to be around for the near future.

If you need to add a page to `vagov-content`, there is [documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vagov-content/blob/main/docs/index.md) in that repo. You should also contact the website team to coordinate with them on where the new page should live.

If you need to add a page to Drupal, coordinate with the cms team via your project manager.
