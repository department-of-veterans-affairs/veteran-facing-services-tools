## Reverse Proxy Config

The reverse proxy handles incoming URL requests to va.gov and is managed through a [reverse proxy routing config](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/revproxy-vagov/vars/react_routes.yml) file.

## React Router

To use client side routing such as react-router, the `react_routes` section must be configured to ignore the route.
For example, a React app running at `www.va.gov/appPath` would need this added:

```yml
- path: /appPath
  protected: no
```

By default, one url path maps to one document. This configuration changes the default behavior so that any additional path parts after `/appPath` like `/appPath/IntroductionPage` will return the document at `/appPath`.

## Server-side Redirects

To redirect from one URL to another, use the `redirects` section with a `src`, `dest`, and optional params such as:

```yaml
# Redirect /caregivers/introduction to /caregivers
- src: /caregivers/introduction
  dest: /caregivers
  rewrite: permanent
```

```yaml
# Redirect various claim process and apply links
- src: /disability-benefits/claims-process/ratings/
  dest: /disability-benefits/eligibility/ratings/
```

```yaml
