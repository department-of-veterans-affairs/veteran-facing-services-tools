# Writing an end-to-end test

Front end engineers use end-to-end (e2e) tests in `vets-website` to validate multipage applications with client-side routing. They are primarily used to assert that:

- client applications render their inputs
- client-side navigation occurs when the required fields are populated

## End-to-end testing overview

- `vets-website` uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) to write end-to-end tests. See [Cypress Best Practices on VSP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/testing/end-to-end/cypress-best-practices-on-vsp.md) and [Cypress Resources Reference Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/testing/end-to-end/vsp-cypress-resources.md) for detailed use cases and documented helpers/mocks.
  - Some older end-to-end tests were written in [Nightwatch](https://nightwatchjs.org) prior to Cypress. All new tests should be written using Cypress moving forward and Nightwatch tests are in the process of being deprecated/migrated to Cypress.
  - Refer to the [Cypress migration guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/testing/end-to-end/cypress-migration-guide.md) to convert old tests or write new tests.
- End-to-end tests are **collocated in application folder** with the application they test
- Cypress tests can be run using the command `yarn cy:run` (after `yarn watch` to `yarn build`).

## End-to-end tests conventions

- Use a comment to indicate what page is being tested
- Disable scrolling
- Assert navigation is successful
- Use functions from the helper file to perform all actions on the page

_These are recommendations, not requirements, except where labeled as 'REQUIRED'_

- Separate navigation from field input
  - Use a **main test file** for navigation, assertions, and calls helpers
  - Use a **helper file** for filling out forms
- Create separate, numbered **main test files** to organize tests by their focus:
  - **00-all-fields.cypress.spec.js** - required and optional fields
  - **01-required.cypress.spec.js** - only required fields
  - **02-accessibility.cypress.spec.js** - validates accessibility
  - **03-auth.cypress.spec.js** - validates authentication
  - **04-cross-cutting-feature.cypress.spec.js** - validates one feature used across several pages (e.g. save in progress)
- Group tests by pages and use a comment to indicate what page is being tested
- Mock all api responses before starting the test. See [Mock API responses](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/testing/end-to-end#mocks)
- Use `waitForElementVisible` before interacting with any element on the page
- Use `Timeouts` constants for setting timeouts (`platform/testing/e2e/timeouts.js`)
- Use helpers for filling data and performing actions on the page
- (_REQUIRED_) Perform `axeCheck` on the main body of the application on each page - see [axeCheck](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/src/platform/testing/e2e/cypress/support/commands/axeCheck.js)
- Assert that each navigation is successful

## Mocking API responses

A mock server runs with the end-to-end tests to allow tests to make production-like calls.

See the [Mocks section of Cypress Resources Reference Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/testing/end-to-end/vsp-cypress-resources.md#mocks) for detailed mock API examples currently used.

Below are some of the commonly used Cypress mocks (accessible from the link above).

- confirmedVA
- confirmedCC
- requests
- cancelReasons
- supportedSites
- facilities
- facilities983
- clinicList983
- slots
- getVAAppointmentMock
- getExpressCareRequestCriteriaMock
- getParentSiteMock

## Custom Cypress commands

Cypress supports extending its client api with [custom commands](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/src/platform/testing/e2e/cypress/support/commands).

Below are some of the commonly used custom Cypress commands.

- [axeCheck](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/src/platform/testing/e2e/cypress/support/commands/axeCheck.js) - Callback from a11y check that logs aXe violations to console output.
- [expandAccordions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/src/platform/testing/e2e/cypress/support/commands/expandAccordions.js) - Expands all accordions and AdditionalInfo components.
- [injectAxeThenAxeCheck](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/src/platform/testing/e2e/cypress/support/commands/hasCount.js) - Combines two common, sequentially called functions.
- [login](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/src/platform/testing/e2e/cypress/support/commands/login.js) - Simulates a logged in session.
- [syncFixtures](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/src/platform/testing/e2e/cypress/support/commands/syncFixtures.js) - Runs task to sync fixtures under a temp path in the Cypress fixtures folder then overwrites `cy.fixture` and the fixture shorthand in `cy.route` to look for fixtures under that temp path.
- [upload](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/src/platform/testing/e2e/cypress/support/commands/upload.js) - Workaround to support file upload functionality in tests, which is currently not officially implemented.
- [viewportPreset](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/master/src/platform/testing/e2e/cypress/support/commands/viewportPreset.js) - Sets the viewport by preset name.

## Helpers

The [Cypress Resources Reference Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/testing/end-to-end) contains a list of currently utilized Cypress & VAOS Helpers adn Appointment Helpers.
