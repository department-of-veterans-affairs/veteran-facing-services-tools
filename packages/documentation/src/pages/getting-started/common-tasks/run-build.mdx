## Prerequisite

- Complete the [first](/getting-started) step in _Start up guide_.

## Locally run VA.gov

Start the watch task:

```bash
yarn watch
```

### Build

#### vets-website

- **Webpack** manages this build pipeline. At a high level, this process:
  1. Starts **Webpack**'s devevelopment server which
     - **Builds** the **JavaScript** and **CSS** bundles
     - **Serves** the **JavaScript** and **CSS** bundles built by Webpack as well as any scaffolded application pages [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

#### content-build

- **Metalsmith** manages this build pipeline. At a high level, this process:
  1. Retrieves and **builds** all of the **static pages** sourced from `vagov-content` or Drupal
  2. **Serves** the **static content** built by Metalsmith at [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)

### Output

- **Metalsmith** in the `content-build` repository outputs **static pages** to`build/localhost`
- **Webpack** in the `vets-website` repository development server has **no output**. **JavaScript** and **CSS** are kept on disk.

### Watch and rebuild

- **Metalsmith** in the `content-build` repository will rebuild **static pages** when changes are saved to **templates** or content in `vagov-content`
- **Webpack** in the `vets-website` repository will rebuild when changes are saved to **JavaScript** or **SCSS**
- Both updates require a browser refresh to see changes.
- Changes to build process or configuration files are typically not picked up, and require a restart of the watch task to become active.

## Locally build and run for specific environment

_Note: most of the time, it's better to use the `watch` task to build the site locally since it is the most developer-friendly experience._

| Environment    | Build Command                                             | Output directory     | Run Command                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| localhost      | `yarn build`                                              | `build/localhost`    | `npx http-server -p 3001 build/localhost`    |
| dev.va.gov     | `yarn build --buildtype=vagovdev`                         | `build/vagovdev`     | `npx http-server -p 3001 build/vagovdev`     |
| staging.va.gov | `NODE_ENV=production yarn build --buildtype=vagovstaging` | `build/vagovstaging` | `npx http-server -p 3001 build/vagovstaging` |
| www.va.gov     | `NODE_ENV=production yarn build --buildtype=vagovprod`    | `build/vagovprod`    | `npx http-server -p 3001 build/vagovprod`    |

### Build commands

- **create** the **static pages** from the markdown content in the `vagov-content` repository and data queried from the Drupal API into their **output directory**
- **create** the **JavaScript** and **CSS** files with Webpack into `/generated` folder in their **output directory** with Webpack

_Production like builds are required for staging and production environments. **NODE_ENV=production** environment variable is required to be set when running these build commands_

### Run commands

- **start** an `http-server` that **serves** the **static pages** from the **output directory** at [http://localhost:3001](https://localhost:3001)

_Typically, the reason for building the site locally like this is to build it in production mode and check that it is behaving as you'd expect._

_**Deep-linking** to urls that are rendered by **React** apps on VA.gov **will not work** when you run the site this way, as that relies on some server-side routing that is handled in nginx (or the Webpack dev server when running the `watch` task)_
