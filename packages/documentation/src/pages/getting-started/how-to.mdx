## How to Add Documents
This is the process of how you should add new pages and documents to this website.

### MDX Format
We will be using the .mdx format to create our documents.
MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly use JSX in your Markdown documents.
You can import components, like interactive charts or notifs, and export metadata.
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast ðŸš€

### Adding React Component documentation
Adding React Components documentation in Formation.

- **Take a look at the example MDX file at formation-react/src/components/AcceptTermsPrompt/AcceptTermsPrompt.mdx.
  You can use this as a starter**

- **Create a .mdx file the same name as your component in the `formation-react/src/components` folder, adjacent to your component.**
    ```
    - components
      - YourComponent.js
      - YourComponent.mdx
    ```
- **Add the required frontmatter at the top of the page**
  ```
    ---
    title: AcceptTermsPrompt
    name: AcceptTermsPrompt
    ---
  ```
- **Add descriptions to your PropTypes in your Component files**

  We need to convert the propType comments to jsDoc format.
  This will not show up in the propTypes definitions on your page if you
  don't have it in a jsDoc format.

  Here is an examples of how it should look:

  Changed code:
  ```javascript
    YourComponent.propTypes = {
      /**
       * content shown as the actual terms and conditions
       */
      user: PropTypes.object,
      /**
       * cancel button click handler
       */
      onCancel: PropTypes.func
    };
  ```

  It will look like this on the page.

  ![proptypes](../images/proptypes.png "PropType Image")

- **Once this is all setup you can start adding your React Component and markdown to your file.**
- **Start gatsby**
    ```
    yarn develop
    ```
- **You should be able to see your component in the sidebar or go to the url.**
    ```
    http://localhost:8000/yourcomponentnamelowercase
    ```
### Adding Document Pages

- **Create a .mdx file in `src/pages`**
- **Add the required frontmatter at the top of the page. You will need this if you
  want it to display in the sidebar.**

  ```markdown
    // Your .mdx page
    ---
    title: How to Add Documents
    ---
  ```
- **You have the option to create React Components and add them to the MDX file.
  React components for pages should be located in src/components**
