## How to Add Documents
This is the process of how you should add new pages and documents to this website.

### MDX Format
We will be using the .mdx format to create our documents.
MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly use JSX in your Markdown documents.
You can import components, like interactive charts or notifs, and export metadata.
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast 🚀

### Adding React Component documentation
Adding React Components documentation in Formation.

- **Take a look at the example MDX file at formation-react/src/components/AcceptTermsPrompt/AcceptTermsPrompt.mdx.
  You can use this as a starter**

- **Create a .mdx file the same name as your component in the `formation-react/src/components` folder, adjacent to your component.**
    ```
    - components
      - YourComponent.js
      - YourComponent.mdx
    ```
- **Add the required frontmatter at the top of the page**
  ```
    ---
    title: AcceptTermsPrompt
    name: AcceptTermsPrompt
    ---
  ```
- **Restart the development server
- **If you run into any errors or your page doesn't render correctly,
  try to delete the .cache file and restart the server again**

- **After you have your page setup you can add markdown and your component code.**

- **Add descriptions to your PropTypes in your Component files**

  We need to convert the propType comments to jsDoc format.
  This will not show up in the propTypes definitions on your page if you
  don't have it in a jsDoc format.

  Here is an examples of how it should look:

  Changed code:
  ```javascript
    YourComponent.propTypes = {
      /**
       * content shown as the actual terms and conditions
       */
      user: PropTypes.object,
      /**
       * cancel button click handler
       */
      onCancel: PropTypes.func
    };
  ```

  It will look like this on the page.

  ![proptypes](../../../images/proptypes.png "PropType Image")

- **Once this is all setup you can start adding your React Component and markdown to your file.**
- **Start gatsby**
    ```
    yarn develop
    ```
- **You should be able to see your component in the sidebar or go to the url.**
    ```
    http://localhost:8000/yourcomponentnamelowercase
    ```

### Adding Document Pages

- **Create a .mdx file in `src/pages`**
- **Add the required frontmatter at the top of the page. You will need this if you
  want it to display in the sidebar.**

  ```markdown
    // Your .mdx page
    ---
    title: How to Add Documents
    ---
  ```
- **You have the option to create React Components and add them to the MDX file.
  React components for pages should be located in src/components**

### Updating the sidebar

After you've added a page, you may want to add it to the sidebar. At `src/sidebar.js`, you'll find the layout for
the main site navigation and sidebar. You can add your page where it makes sense in the site's information architecture.

There are examples in the sidebar file to follow. You'll need to add an object with `name` and `href` properties
for regular links and you can also create nested sections by leaving out `href` and adding an `items` array to objects.
