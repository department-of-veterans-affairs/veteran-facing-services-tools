# Documentation style guide

This is a description of our house style for writing documentation. The goal is to establish recommendations that assist engineers with creating clear, consistent, and concise documentation. This is **not a set of rules** to follow.

## Tone

At a high level, the tone of your documentation should adhere to the same [content principles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles) used on VA.gov. Expanding on those content principles, your documentation should also be inclusive and simple to use.

### Inclusive

- Be kind, conversational, and helpful
- Avoid jargon, ambiguity, and vague or complex wording

### Simple to use

- **Stick to the goal** of the document
  - Teach a concept
  - Show how to follow a process
  - Provide background and context for a concept or process
- **Avoid duplication** by linking to other documents
  - Duplicate documenation is hard to change
  - Avoid summarizing other documentation
  - Use descriptive link text
- **Keep** paragraphs and sentences **clear and concise**
- **Strive** for **brisk pacing** and **precise language

## Structure

- Use section intro to summarize and **link to other documents**
  - Every page should be linked from a summary page to encourage discoverability
- **Organize by topic** not type
  - Recommended: documentation about setting up testing, understanding how forms system is organized
  - Not recommended: a list of tutorials or an index of diagrams
- Use clean markdown
  - Indent with 2 spaces
  - Add a space between different markdown types

## Emphasis

- **Double asterisks** for `**bold**`
- **Underscore** for `_italics_`
- **Greater than** for `> block quotes`
- Make documents easy to scan by emphasizing **subjects**, **actors** and **verbs**

## Lists

- Use **numbered lists** for **sequences**
  - Number lists with 1. for every step
- Use **bulleted lists** for most **other lists**
- **Alphabetize** when not using another type of order
- **Indent** subitems with **2 spaces**

## Code

- **Prefer code blocks** to inline code
- **Fence code blocks** with **three back ticks** and language for syntax highlighting
  - **Recommended**:

>- Install yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```

  - **Not recommended**:
>Run `yarn install`

### Lists with code

- **Provide complete code** snippets as a separate code block
- **Explain** what the code does **before** the **code block**
- Put **conditional clauses before instructions**
- Use [imperative mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood) (implicit you)

>- **Recommended**:

1. Install `nvm`:

```bash
brew update && brew install nvm
```

_Follow the post install instructions in the success message._

1. Install `node 8.10.0` (this also installs `npm`):

````bash
nvm install 8.10.0
````

>- **Not recommended**:

1. You can install nvm by running `brew update` and `brew install nvm`. Once that's finished, run `nvm install 8.10.0`

## Language and grammar

- **Write** in **second person** (you instead of we)
  - Make it clear to the reader who you expect them to be (e.g. devops, front end, product manager)
  - **Not recommended**
    - _If we're deleting multiple entries at a time ..._
  - **Recommended**
    - _If you're deleting multiple entries at a time ..._
    - _When deleting multiple entries at a time ..._
- **Explain** things **in terms of what to do** rather than what not to do (positive voice)
  - **Not recommended**: N won't happen, if you don't XYZ.
   - **Recommended**: To make N happen, do XYZ.
- **Clarify antecedents**
  - **Not recommended**: If you use the term "green beer" in an ad, then make sure it's targeted.
  - **Recommended**: If you use the term "green beer" in an ad, then make sure **the ad** is targeted.
- **Avoid** misplaced modifiers
  - **Not recommended**: Developers only need to apply for one token.
  - **Recommended**: Developers need to apply for only one token.
- **Avoid** abbreviations
  - **Not recommended**: js, ui, ux, VFS
  - **Recommended**: JavaScript, user interface, user experience, veteran facing tools
- Use [active voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_voice)
 - **Not recommended**: The extension must be registered.
 - **Recommended**: You must register the extension.
- Use [serial commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma#Creating_ambiguity)

## Images

- Prepend image names with document name
- Use specific names
- **Images** should **illustrate a description** but never replace it
- **Not recommended**: img2.png, process-diagram.png
- **Recommended**: deploy-jenkins-process-diagram.png
