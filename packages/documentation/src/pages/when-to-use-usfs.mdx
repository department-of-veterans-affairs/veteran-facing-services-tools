title: When to use the US Forms System
---

## General structure of applications built with US Forms System

The US Forms System provides a simple way to create a consistent form experience for veterans. Applications created with this framework follow this flow:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A(Introduction Page) --> B(Form Pages Start)
    B -. Form Pages .-> C(Review Page)
    C -- Submission --> D(Confirmation Page)
```

## When to use the US Forms System

The US Forms system is best suited for forms that

- are long enough to be organized across multiple pages,
- have optionally captured or required fields, and
- require field level or multiple field validation.

The US Forms System shouldn't be used when
- the form is simple enough to fit on a single page, or
- when the user experience doesn't benefit from **all** of the steps documented in the above flow.

In these cases, it's recommended to either make simple single page form or to deploy a React app that doesn't use the US Forms System.
