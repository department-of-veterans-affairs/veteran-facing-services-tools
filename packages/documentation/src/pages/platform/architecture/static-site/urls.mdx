Understanding how content URLs are generated by Metalsmith helps prevent build errors. Here's how it works.

## Pages in vagov-content

- Document paths are based on the Markdown file paths.
- Each Markdown file generates a corresponding directory and `index.html` file. For example:
  - `_education/tools-programs.md` → `/education/tools-programs/index.html`
  - `_education/tools-programs/index.md` → `/education/tools-programs/index.html`
  - `_education/work-learn/non-traditional.md` → `_education/work-learn/non-traditional/index.html`

***Make sure that every collection sub-directory also has a Markdown file that shares its name.*** Take the the `_employment/job-seekers/` directory as an example. It also has an `_employment/job-seekers.md` file. Each Markdown file in `_employment/job-seekers/` compiles to `employment/jobs-seekers/name_of_markdown_file/index.html`, while `_employment/job-seekers.md` itself compiles to `employment/job-seekers/index.html`.

Failing to take the above step means that you could generate breadcrumbs to pages that do not exist.

## Pages in Drupal

In Drupal, URLs are created based off the `entityUrl.path` property included on each node. Similar to vagov-content pages, an index.html page is appended to that path, so that urls can reference just the path without an html extension.
