# How templates work for Markdown pages

Templates use [tinyliquid](https://github.com/leizongmin/tinyliquid/), a JavaScript implementation of [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).

There are three "wrapper" templates currently in use for Markdown content. They're all in `src/site/layouts`.

- `page-react`: Houses our React pages.
- `page-react-sidebar`: Houses our React pages that have a sidebar.
- `page-breadcrumbs`: Houses our non-React content pages.
- `page-playbook`: Houses Playbook pages.
- `home`: Template for the home page
- `home`: Template for the home page without search

`page-breadcrumbs` is a container template that loads layouts for the content between the header and the footer. Those are in `content/layouts/includes/`.

Templates are loaded based on the value of the `template` property in the [YAML](http://yaml.org/)/front-page data of each content file -- the text between the `---`. Content files can be found in `content/pages/`.

## Adding a new template

- Add a new HTML + Liquid template file to `src/site/includes`
- Update `page-breadcrumbs` with a new case for the new layout.
- Update the `template` YAML property for whichever pages should load the new template.

## Content meta data

To date, we've used [YAML](http://yaml.org/) syntax in Markdown files as a way to structure data such as related links (majorlinks) and navigation cards.
