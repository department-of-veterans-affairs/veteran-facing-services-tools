# Reverse Proxy

The vagov-revproxy service is a reverse proxy designed to accept traffic coming from 
the Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) and direct that traffic towards private S3 
resources (static content, ie. css, images, etc.).

Static site content is housed within a bucket or multiple buckets (AWS S3) for the 
respective environment of the traffic (sandbox, dev, staging, or prod).

Our reverse proxy nodes use OpenRestyÂ®, an enhanced version of Nginx core.

## Configuration

The deployment of the reverse proxy configuration:

- [sandbox](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/revproxy-vagov-sandbox.yml#L77-L81)
- [dev](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/revproxy-vagov-dev.yml#L85-L89)
- [staging](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/revproxy-vagov-staging.yml#L77-L81)
- [prod](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/revproxy-vagov-prod.yml#L78-L82)

Each deployment calls the `nginx` file [nginx_website_server](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/revproxy-vagov/templates/nginx_website_server.conf.j2#L17) which passes the corresponding properties depending on each environment. It also calls [nginx_revproxy_redirects](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/revproxy-vagov/templates/nginx_revproxy_redirects.conf.j2) to handle the port 80/443 requests

Nginx conf files containing the properties for each environment:

- [sandbox](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/revproxy-vagov/vars/nginx_config_vagov-sandbox.yml)
- [dev](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/revproxy-vagov/vars/nginx_config_vagov-dev.yml)
- [staging](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/revproxy-vagov/vars/nginx_config_vagov-staging.yml)
- [prod](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/revproxy-vagov/vars/nginx_config_vagov-prod.yml)

## Proxy headers

Our current nginx config only provides for proxying to s3 buckets that have the same name as the site for which 
they are being proxied. However, in order to use a specific S3 bucket a new proxy header was created to handle t
his by not overriding the [host header for s3 requests](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/revproxy-vagov/files/proxy-headers-s3.conf).
