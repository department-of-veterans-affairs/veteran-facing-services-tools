|**Last Decision Made:**|Remove signin from Teamsite header| **Decision Date:** | 10/2018 |
|**Revisit Decision:**| No | | |

For the immediate term (i.e. for Nov 7 Launch), we will remove Sign In / Sign Up from the injected header/footer **for sub-domain pages only** and instead display some CTA to return to the home VA.gov site to sign in. This CTA will be static, so will not change based on whether the user is already logged in or not.
