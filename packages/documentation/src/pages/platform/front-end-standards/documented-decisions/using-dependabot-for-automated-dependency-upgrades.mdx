# Dependabot in `vets-website` repo

**Author:** Jhonny Gonzalez

**Last Updated:** June 25, 2020

## Overview

This is a decision making process to choose the most efficient automated dependency upgrade product.

Based on this [evaluation of automated dependency upgrade products](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/9537). The final decision is to go with `Dependabot`

## Objective

To be able to rely on a automated dependency upgrade manager

## Background

`Dependabot` was initially installed in `vets-website` but it wasn't doing anything. There was no action by `Dependabot`, therefore, we started looking at alternatives.

[This ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/9537) has an evaluation of Depfu, Renovate and Dependabot.

`dependabot` has good settings and also [it's been integrated into GitHub](https://dependabot.com/blog/hello-github/).
