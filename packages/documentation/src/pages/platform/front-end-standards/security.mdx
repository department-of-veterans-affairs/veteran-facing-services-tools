# Front end security 

`vets-website` uses modern browser features to provide a secure experience for veterans. In general, these features are automatically included through the deployment process and require no configuration by front end engineers. 

_This is an overview not an implementation guide. These rules apply to VA.gov production environments. Not all security features will be used in local, development, or staging environments._ 

## HTTPS

- All connections made to VA.gov must be secure (HTTPS)
- VA.gov implements HSTS and automatically redirects to a secure protocol if a non secure connection is attempted 

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

- Some cross origin connections made to VA.gov must support CORS including **all** XHR connections and web font downloads. 
- Updates to CORS headers returned by `vets-api` services or `vets-website` assets must be made through the devops team and must be reviewed by the [frontend review group](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/teams/frontend-review-group). Example:  
  - Your application is on a VA.gov subdomain, needs to connect to `vets-api`, but is not currently listed in the allowed origins

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

- All VA.gov pages return a Content Security Policy header that allows only known scripts to run on the page
- The CSP is enforced i.e. not set to `report-only`
- The `report-uri` points to a VA platform error capturing service (Sentry)
  - VA.gov throttles these reports by including the `report-uri` only on a small % of responses
- Updates to CSP headers returned by or `vets-website` assets must be made through the devops team and must be reviewed by the [frontend review group](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/teams/frontend-review-group)
- More [info on CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
