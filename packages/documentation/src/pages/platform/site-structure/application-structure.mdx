# Application structure

In this doc, we'll go over how VA.gov applications are structured and how they use shared platform code.


## Structure of a page

A typical application page on VA.gov looks something like this:

![Abbreviated dashboard with red boxes drawn around React mount points](../../../images/platform/react-mount-points.png)

Each of the areas marked with a red box is a separately mounted React component. These React components shared a common Redux store:

graph TD
A[Redux store]
B[User navigation]-->A
C[Site navigation]-->A
D[Main application]-->A
E[Footer]
F[Announcements]-->A
```
