# Unit testing

All new code that is added to `vets-website` should be unit tested. Write unit tests as you build to make sure your form (or other component) is behaving as you expect and to help guard against future bugs. Your test files should go in a `tests` folder in your application folder.

See [Write a unit test](/getting-started/common-tasks/new-unit-test) for more information.
