All new code that is added to `vets-website` should be unit tested and unit tests should cover at least 75% of code paths. Write unit tests as you build to make sure your form (or other component) is behaving as you expect and to help guard against future bugs.

**Unit test file format:** *file_name*.unit.spec.js

**Where:** Any *file_name*.unit.spec.js file located in the `/src` folder. This file is usually located in a test directory close to the code being tested.

**When:** [Run the test](/getting-started/common-tasks/test) locally through npm script commands, during the Jenkins build (Unit), and after merging to master.

**How:** [Write a unit test.](/getting-started/common-tasks/new-unit-test)

**Libraries used:**

- [mocha.js](https://mochajs.org/): Test framework.
