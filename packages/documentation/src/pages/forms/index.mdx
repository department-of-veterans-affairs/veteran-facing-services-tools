# VA.gov Forms System

The VA.gov Forms System (VAFS) provides a simple way to create a consistent experience for complex forms for Veterans. Applications created with this framework generally follow this flow:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A(Introduction Page) --> B(Form Pages Start)
    B -. Form Pages .-> C(Review Page)
    C -- Submission --> D(Confirmation Page)
```

VAFS consists of several different pieces:

- Standardized **inputs and field sets** for common types of form data
- **Validation functions** used for commonly collected types of data
- A standardized **data flow** within the application that triggers validation and updates conditionally displayed UI
- Hooks for custom validation, hiding/showing fields, and writing custom fields and widgets
- Save and restore form data using the VA.gov save in progress and prefill APIs

## When to use VAFS 

VAFS is best suited for forms that

- are long enough to be organized across multiple pages,
- have optionally captured or required fields, and
- require field level or multiple field validation.

VAFS shouldn't be used when
- the form is simple enough to fit on a single page, or
- when the user experience doesn't benefit from **all** of the steps documented in the above flow.

In these cases, it's recommended to either make simple single page form or to deploy a React app that doesn't use VAFS. We have form components available in the formation-react library, which can view [here](/platform).
