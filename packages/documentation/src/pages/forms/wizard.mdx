# Form wizard

## Product details

The design system [wizard pattern documentation](https://design.va.gov/patterns/wizards) provides a general overview of how the wizard should look and work.

More details can be found in these documents:

- Product: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/public-websites/how-to-apply-wizards
- [IA documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/ia-reviews/websites-apply-wizard.md) for implementation teams; also includes some UX documenation
- Additional UX guidance captured in [UXPin documentation](https://preview.uxpin.com/ca08f3dbf63475b2b62f3e8c00050ad1b19c4cb5#/pages/132986657/documentation/no-panels?mode=i) (using Edu flow as an example)

## File structure

There isn't a provided template for the wizard, but you can copy the `wizard`
folder from any of the forms that include one. Given that, this will only be a
brief review of how to setup the wizard

A `wizard` folder is usually added under the form root folder.

```
form
|_ ...
|_ components
|  |_ createApplicationStatus.jsx
|_ wizard
   |_ WizardContainer.jsx
   |_ WizardLink.jsx
   |_ pages
      |_ index.js (returns an array of all pages)
      |_ start.jsx (or whatever you name the first page)
      |_ ... (other pages; usually named after wizard nodes)
```

Within this folder are a `WizardContainer` which renders the content surrounding
the actual `Wizard` component. A `WizardLink` may be found if the info page needs
to render a link to the start of your form conditionally (behind a feature flag).

Within the `pages` folder, are pages that represent each wizard node. The
`index.js` imports all the pages and exports an array with the first entry being
the wizard start page. Each page file _must_ export the following object which
contains the page name and component.

```js
export default {
  name: 'component-name',
  component: Component,
};
```

Each page will likely contain analytics events. More details can be found in the
[wizard analytics spec](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/google-analytics/tracking-how-to-wizards.md).

## Setup

Set up the files as described in the previous section.

There is a difference if you decide to render the wizard on either the
Introduction page, or in the `FormApp` wrapper.

### Render wizard in the Intro page

In the `formConfig` (`config/form.js`), ensure a `wizardStorageKey` is included.
It should be unique (recomended), and match the `sessionStorage` key used by
whatever method is used to show or hide the wizard on the intro page.

In the `formConfig` set up a `restartFormCallback` option inside the
`saveInProgress` settings. Set it as a function that returns a URL destination.
Most likely it will return `'/'`, which targets the introduction page.

```js
const formConfig = {
  // ...
  wizardStorageKey: 'wizardStatus',
  saveInProgress: {
    // return restart destination url; only needed if wizard rendered by Intro
    restartFormCallback: () => '/', // introduction page
  },
  // ...
};
```

### Render wizard in the App file

If the wizard is rendered by the main `FormApp.jsx` wrapper, then you'll need to
check if the form has restarted (using `restartShouldRedirect` helper function),
then push the restart destination URL to the router

`App.jsx` (example code)

```js
import WizardContainer from './containers/WizardContainer';
import { WIZARD_STATUS } from './constants'; // should be unique to the form
import {
  WIZARD_STATUS_NOT_STARTED,
  WIZARD_STATUS_COMPLETE,
  WIZARD_STATUS_RESTARTED,
  restartShouldRedirect,
} from 'platform/site-wide/wizard';

export const FormEntry = ({
  const [wizardState, setWizardState] = useState(
    sessionStorage.getItem(WIZARD_STATUS) || WIZARD_STATUS_NOT_STARTED
  );

  const hasRestarted = () => {
    setWizardStatus(WIZARD_STATUS_RESTARTED);
    sessionStorage.setItem(WIZARD_STATUS, value);
    router.push('/');
  };

  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    if (restartShouldRedirect(WIZARD_STATUS)) {
      hasRestarted();
    }
    // ...
  });

  if (wizardState !== WIZARD_STATUS_COMPLETE) {
    return <WizardContainer />;
  }
  // ...
});
```

The `formConfig` will also require the wizard status setting so that the form
restart link properly adjusts the session storage value.

```js
const formConfig = {
  // ...
  wizardStorageKey: 'wizardStatus',
  // ...
};
```

A `restartFormCallback` is not set in this case because we're handling it in the
app.

### Application status

A component (see `createApplicationStatus` in the file structure section) to
render the `ApplicationStatus` is also contained somewhere within the form
files. A static page component imports and injects the application status
component into the form's info page. Within this component are two buttons which
allow the user to either continue or restart the application.

Too ensure the wizard is properly handled when restarting (clear the wizard
state) or continuing (set the wizard state to complete), we need to provide the
`WIZARD_STATUS` session storage key to the component

```js
<ApplicationStatus
  formIds="XX-XXXX"
  formType="What this form does"
  wizardStatus={WIZARD_STATUS}
  // ...
/>
```
