# About the schema and uiSchema

The VA.gov Forms Library lets you build web-based forms using a simple React component that is capable of building HTML forms out of a JSON schema. You can customize the look and feel of your form using the `schema` and `uiSchema`. The form data is represented by `schema` objects and the user interface (UI) is represented by `uiSchema` objects, which are included in the form configuration file.

- [JSON Schema](/forms/schema)
- [uiSchema](/forms/uiSchema)
