The reason for this is because tying a component to the Redux store couples it to a particular slice of the state of your application, as well as coupling it to a particular way of organizing your state. So refactoring a lot of container components can be difficult. Debugging can also be difficult with a lot of container components, because they interrupt the usual flow of data down through components.
