The standards are a combination of best practice principles, policies and legal requirements for designing and delivering digital services. The lists below connect you to resources to help you meet these standards.</p>\n<h2>Research</h2>\n<p>Develop a deep understanding of your users, how they behave, and what that means for the design of your service. Engage users for research and feedback throughout the life cycle of your product.</p>\n<h3>How to meet research standards</h3>\n<h4>Research planning</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow DEPO Platform guidelines for <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-process.md\">research process and recruiting</a>.</li>\n<li>Have your <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-plan-template.md\">research plan</a> and research <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md\">conversation guide</a> reviewed and approved by DEPO’s research expert in a <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle/vsp-collaboration-cycle.md#research-plan-review\">Research Plan Review</a>. </li>\n<li>Follow DEPO Platform guidelines for <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/README.md\">scheduling and running research sessions</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Usability testing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Test the service with real users and document what you learned. Identify the parts users found difficult and plan to adjust your designs to make those parts easier to understand. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Conducting research</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow DEPO Platform guidance for <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/synthesis/what-to-do-with-research-session-recordings.md\">research session recordings</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Synthesizing research</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Document your research synthesis in your team’s product folder in the <code>va.gov-team</code> repo.</li>\n<li>Update <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-history.md\">History of research projects on Veteran-facing tools</a> with information about your research.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Validating functionality</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Participate in <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/what-is-uat.md\">UAT</a> when your tool, service, or feature is in production to validate everything works as intended.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Design</h2>\n<p>The user experience of your service must be consistent with other VA digital services. Use existing VA.gov Design System components and patterns to a cohesive experience. Instill confidence in your users by creating a service that feels familiar to other Veteran-facing services they already use. </p>\n<h3>How to meet design standards</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https://design.va.gov/\">VA.gov Design System</a> for your designs.</li>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/design-checklist-for-usability-testing-and-staging-revi.md\">VSP design review checklist</a> to ensure that important design considerations are not missed or forgotten.</li>\n<li>If existing VA.gov Design System options do not meet your needs and you need to create a modified or new component/pattern, <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/new/choose\">submit an issue ticket</a>. The Design System Council will review your request and determine whether to add it to the <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/projects/3\">Design System Governance Process Board</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Accessibility is about making sure your service is usable by everyone. Thinking about this from the beginning will help you make sure that no one is excluded. Designing for accessibility, we’re not just talking about designing for people with disabilities. We mean designing for people in the widest variety of real-life circumstances.</p>\n<p>All users will have different needs at different times and in different circumstances. For example, a person’s ability to use your service can be affected by their:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Health - they may be recovering from a stroke or traumatic brain injury, or they may have a broken arm and be unable to use their mouse</li>\n<li>Location - they may be in a noisy cafe or an area with slow wifi</li>\n<li>Equipment - they may be on a mobile phone or using an older browser</li>\n<li>Digital experience - they may need phone (or in-person) assistance while using your service</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to meet accessibility standards</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Involve an accessibility specialist early in your product development.</li>\n<li>Follow <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/508-accessibility-best-practices.md\">Section 508 accessibility and inclusive design best practices</a>.</li>\n<li>Before launching your service, <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/guidance/staging-review-processes.md#required-accessibility-tests\">complete all required accessibility tests</a> and resolve any 508-defect-0 and 508-defect-1 issues.
