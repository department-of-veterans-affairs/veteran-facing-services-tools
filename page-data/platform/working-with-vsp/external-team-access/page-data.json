However, GovCloud contains information about Amazon services that external teams should not have access to.</p>\n<h3>Logging</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Now</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If BAH or Community Care teams want to see logs, they should do this via their review instances.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They can ssh to the review instance and see the logs there. These are the \"same\" as staging/production.</li>\n<li>They can also see dashboard and metrics from grafana and exceptions in sentry.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When their code goes to staging/production, if there are errors, they will need AdHoc/DSVA help to view those. E.g., AdHoc/DSVA will notice the error and need to contact the external team so they can figure it out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Errors that might occur in staging/production are likely to be environment-related errors.</li>\n<li>We will have to wait and see if this becomes a problem (e.g., it's taking too much time for AdHoc/DSVA).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mid-term</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Create a system to expose the logs for the external team's portion of the environments logs with an audit trail like Heroku.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>May not be needed depending on when the Future process is completed vs the time it would take to complete this Mid-term effort.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Future</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When external teams always go through the PIV process, we should trust them with access to GovCloud.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>New services</h3>\n<p>External teams who need to provision a new service need to do so through the DSVA Product Manager, who will talk with the appropriate DSVA/AdHoc people to make it happen.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Github repos - Previous - Jul-Aug 2018</h2>\n<h4>For reference</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>vets.gov-team - WRITE access</strong> - Parent team</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows external team to reference related product information and process docs, as well as file agile/project management issues and issues requesting DSVA review/support.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>vets.gov-ato - READ access</strong> - Parent team</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows external team to review the ATO documents for the Veteran Tools Platform and reference them if needed within VA.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>vets-website - WRITE access</strong> - Subteam</li>\n<li><strong>vets-api - WRITE access</strong> - Subteam</li>\n<li><strong>vets-json-schema - WRITE access</strong> - Subteam</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>vets-api-mockdata - READ access</strong> - Subteam</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access to the above 4 repos allows external team to work with the Veteran Tools Platform code.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>devops - READ access</strong> - Subteam</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read access allows them to view/clone the <code>ssh-config</code> file in this repo, which they need to use the SOCKS proxy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>vets-contrib - READ access</strong> - Subteam</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read access allows them to be notified when their SSH key has been added to the list of authorized keys.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","source":"va.gov-team","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/external-team-access.md","title":"Access for External Teams"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864","68798663"]}
