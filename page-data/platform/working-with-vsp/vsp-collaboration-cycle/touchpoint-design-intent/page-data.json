If so, follow the below guidelines to get started.</p>\n<h2>When should I request this touchpoint?</h2>\n<p>When you are brainstorming and drafting how you are going to approach your solution. When you have an idea of how to solve the problem.</p>\n<h2>What is the collaboration format?</h2>\n<p>Synchronous 30-minute meeting (recommended), or asynchronous review</p>\n<h2>What is the objective of this touchpoint?</h2>\n<p>Collaborate with VSP to identify any areas that may need additional support.</p>\n<p>VSP team: We’ll review your responses to the Collaboration Cycle Kickoff questions. We will share existing design components and research findings relevant to the problem you’re trying to solve.</p>\n<p>VFS team: You’ll introduce your new work initiative and discuss existing solutions in the problem space. You’ll  present a draft of ideas to VSP and other expert designers. You’ll also have the opportunity to discuss accessibility considerations with VSP accessibility experts.</p>\n<p>We recommend a synchronous meeting for the Design Intent touchpoint since this is the first time you’re introducing VSP to your product and/or iteration.
