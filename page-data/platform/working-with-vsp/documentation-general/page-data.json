Some is duplicated in 2 (or more) locations. Where content is duplicated, it is difficult to tell which of the content supercedes the other content in different location(s).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This creates problems for DSVA, AdHoc, and external teams -- people need to ask someone which documentation is the most current. \"Asking people\" isn't scalable.</li>\n<li>We want a single source of truth for \"work practices.\"</li>\n<li>We want to point to those sources of truth from public-facing websites like the Handbook and the API site, as well as from other documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Most documentation is in private repos. This means we have to manage Github access for external teams, which creates admin overhead. It's also error prone, which creates more instances of \"asking people.\"</li>\n<li>Some \"work practices\" differ depending on whether the team is internal or external, e.g., how to get your SSH key added to the authorized list is different for the two team types.</li>\n<li>Documentation is not as thorough as it should be -- assumes knowledge on the part of the reader that we shouldn't assume, e.g., that people know what a Github pull request is.</li>\n<li>Some documentation is not relevant to DSVA or to external contractors, e.g., <a href=\"\">PIV card process</a> is AdHoc-specific and should not be in the VA Github org.</li>\n<li>Many repositories are named \"vets.gov.\" Since that is no longer our domain, we'd like to rename our repos. Also we have too many repos (why is there a separate repo for the content style guide?) We could use this time/effort to better organize our repos.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Solution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A central location for all \"work practices\" documentation</li>\n<li>The location is a public repo with READ access</li>\n<li>Consistent labeling indicates when a process differs for internal vs external teams</li>\n<li>All documentation thoroughly explains each process</li>\n<li>All documentation is generalized so that it applies to anyone who works on the Veteran Tools Platform. Any DSVA-specific content is moved to the private DSVA-only digitalservice repo. AdHoc-specific content is moved to AdHoc's Github org.</li>\n<li>Rename our repos so they make sense to a person who has none of the historical knowledge of the vets.gov team or its work.</li>\n<li>Consolidate repos so there are fewer \"places I have to go to look for things.\"</li>\n<li>All documentation is written in Markdown -- the easiest-to-use markup language. This allows DSVA and AdHoc to quickly make changes without wasting time (e.g., waiting 5 minutes for a change to render in Fractal - ugh).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Technical Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When we move content from repo to repo (or delete it), we want to retain Github history.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Current situation - <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/documentation-current2.png\">see image</a></h2>\n<h3>vets-contrib repo</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-contrib\">Repo</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> \"Ad Hoc vets.gov issues &#x26; docs\"</li>\n<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Private</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Contains:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A very <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-contrib/tree/master/Developer%20Process\">slimmed-down version of \"Developer Process\" for website and api</a></li>\n<li>Developer process documentation to support the VA APIs site, e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-contrib/tree/master/docs/External%20Services/Central%20Mail\">Central Mail</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-contrib/tree/master/developer-portal\">Code for the public-facing VA APIs site</a></li>\n<li>Meeting notes</li>\n<li>Misc materials from AdHoc platform pilot and other random stuff</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Current READ access to repo:</strong> Yes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Process was changed so we don't need external teams to access this repo anymore. <del>They only have access to this because this is where Liz files an issue for SSH keys to be added.
