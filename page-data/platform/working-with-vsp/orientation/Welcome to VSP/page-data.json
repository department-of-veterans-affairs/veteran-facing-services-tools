As you develop your product, we’ll be your support team helping you through the VA.gov ecosystem, best practices, and processes, including the iterative cycle of ideation and strategy, user testing, launching code, and measuring results.</p>\n<h2>What is VA.gov?</h2>\n<p>The website serving as the single place Veterans can go to find, apply for, track, and manage the benefits they've earned.</p>\n<h2>What is a Veteran-facing Services (VFS) team?</h2>\n<p>You are! Any sprint team building online Veteran-facing experiences is a VFS team.</p>\n<h2>What is the VSP?</h2>\n<p>The VSP is the common infrastructure, technical and non-technical components, and processes that support static and interactive content consumed by Veterans via VA.gov. Major pieces of the VSP include a set of APIs that manage communication between a Veteran user and internal VA resources, an identity and authentication system, the VA.gov Design System, reusable frontend components, a Drupal-based content management system, and an extensive set of documentation and guides.</p>\n<h2>How should VFS teams expect to get up and running?</h2>\n<p>Here's a sample timeline of what you should expect to do as you prepare to start designing / building / iterating in collaboration with VSP.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/VSP_Onboarding_Timeline.001.png\"></p>\n<h2>Working in the open</h2>\n<p>We work in the open and strive to keep as much of our code and other work product in publicly accessible open source repositories. You will have access to our open source (i.e. public) GitHub repository for tracking work and documentation. <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/policies-work-norms/sensitive-guidance.md\">Here are some ground rules to make sure you know what <em>not</em> to do when working in a public repo</a>.</p>\n<h2>What should VFS Teams expect to do as they design, build, launch, iterate?</h2>\n<p>Here are materials you should start familiarizing yourself with to help you learn how to create online experiences the VA.gov way, and how to work with VSP as you go.</p>\n<h3>Product</h3>\n<p>Document what you're building, what problem it's solving, what outcomes you hope it achieves, and how you'll measure success.
