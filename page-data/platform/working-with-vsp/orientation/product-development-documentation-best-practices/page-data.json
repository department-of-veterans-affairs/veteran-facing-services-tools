This document is a guide containing standards and best practices for how documentation is written and maintained as well as the expectations for new documentation creation and organization.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Archive Folder</strong>: a <em>special</em> folder that can be created/exist within any folder as a place for storing files that are out of date (no longer relevant)</li>\n<li><strong>If you find something out of date - update or archive</strong>: everyone should feel empowered to make updates or move any file. We want our documentation to stay as up to date/relevant as possible. When you find something that's no longer accurate, make a change or notify someone.</li>\n<li><strong>Write descriptive but concise commit messages</strong>: when a change is made in Github, it is accompanied by a commit message. Please do your best to write clear commit messages to help others understand what changes were made to each file.</li>\n<li><strong>Take time to find the right place to put new files</strong>: things get unwieldy when files are put in the wrong place. Save time down the line, by taking time to identify the right directory to create new files.</li>\n<li><strong>Consolidate when possible</strong>: there will be times when files are duplicated in differing places. As a team we should all do our best to find opportunities to consolidate files when possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Always link to the README.md</strong>: when you're trying to direct team members to the instructions within a directory - linking to the README avoid all of the clutter of the folders up top.</li>\n<li><strong>Write descriptive, readable titles for your documents</strong>: Avoid naming your documents by date or number. Instead, give documents titles that are logical and readable by humans. Separate the words with dashes. It's okay if they get a little long! For example: <a href=\"https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system/blob/master/docs/getting-started/tools-for-getting-started-with-the-us-forms-system.md\">tools-for-getting-started-with-the-us-forms-system.md</a></li>\n<li><strong>Fix errors you find</strong>: Maintaining healthy documentation requires everyone to pitch in. If you find a broken link, or any other type of error, do what you can to fix it yourself or track down someone who can help.</li>\n<li><strong>Write a product outline for each product you build</strong>: It's important for anyone who visits a product folder to be able to understand the context, goals, and points of contact of that product. Put the product outline content into the README of the product folder. <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/product-management/product-outline-template.md\">Use this template</a> as a guide to writing your product outlines.</li>\n<li><strong>Create a consistent product folder structure</strong>: Each product folder should organize the work into the following folders: Discovery, Research, Design, and Content. [Needs validation from a PM]</li>\n</ul>","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/product-development-documentation-best-practices.md","title":"Documentation Best Practices at VA.gov"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864","4193446859","4277382034"]}
