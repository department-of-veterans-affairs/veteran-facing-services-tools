You can see the builds without logging in, but will need to authenticate (with GitHub OAuth) to re-run failed builds.</p>\n<h3>Sentry</h3>\n<p>With the Socks proxy set up and running, go to <a href=\"http://sentry.vfs.va.gov\">http://sentry.vfs.va.gov</a>.</p>\n<p>VSP uses Sentry teams to separate production, staging, and dev errors. To view the most recent production errors, which is the most common thing to do while on call, go to <a href=\"http://sentry.vfs.va.gov/vets-gov/platform-api-production/\">http://sentry.vfs.va.gov/vets-gov/platform-api-production/</a>.</p>\n<h3>Grafana</h3>\n<p>With the Socks proxy set up and running, go to <a href=\"http://grafana.vfs.va.gov/login\">http://grafana.vfs.va.gov/login</a>. You can sign in using your GitHub account by clicking the \"GitHub\" button on the login page.</p>\n<p>There are many dashboards and you should click around to get familiar with the variety of metrics being collected and visualized (make sure Data Source is set to Production). A few highlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://grafana.vfs.va.gov/dashboard/db/site\">Site</a> provides overall metrics about the health of the site.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://grafana.vfs.va.gov/dashboard/db/external-service-status\">External Service Status</a> allows you to see the availability of the services vets.gov depends on.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://grafana.vfs.va.gov/dashboard/db/rds\">RDS</a> provides database statistics.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://grafana.vfs.va.gov/dashboard/db/revproxy\">Rev Proxy</a> provides metrics on the reverse proxies.</li>\n</ul>","source":"va.gov-team","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/request-access-to-tools.md","title":"Getting access to tools"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864","68798663"]}
