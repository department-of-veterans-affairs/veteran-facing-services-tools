An intro to Zenhub can be found <a href=\"https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000010778-what-is-zenhub-an-intro-to-zenhub-in-github\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>It may be useful to see Zenhub as a layer of data that sits on top of github issues and offers additional functionality and features.</p>\n<p>The difference between a github issue and a Zenhub issue is further described in the <a href=\"https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000458338-what-is-zenhub-vs-github-in-an-issue\">Zenhub documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Zenhub onboarding</h2>\n<p>To start using Zenhub, you can follow the onboarding process described here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/zenhub_onboarding.pdf\">Zenhub orientation</a></li>\n<li>Zenhub admins are in Slack, @admins-zenhub.</li>\n<li>User should connect to Zenhub using their agency mail (Github connect is no longer supported), then request a license. Zenhub admins will see the license request and can grant the license.</li>\n<li>If a user isn't prompted to request a license, we don't know how to fix that yet, working with Zenhub support.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Requesting a Zenhub license</h3>\n<p>If after following the onboarding instructions above, you see a screen like the below stating \"You have not been assigned a license; Contact an admin to request access\", </p>\n<p><img src=\"zenhub-license-request.png\" alt=\"zenhub license request\"></p>\n<p>try to click the button to request a license, then wait 1 business day for access to be granted.</p>\n<p>If after 1 day, Zenhub still doesn't work, please create a new thread in <a href=\"https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CBU0KDSB1\">#vfs-platform-support</a> and ping @admins-zenhub to request that they grant your license. Please provide your github username so they can process the request.</p>\n<h2>Product management with Zenhub</h2>\n<p>The product management process for Zenhub is described here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/zenhub_product_management.pdf\">Product Management Process in Zenhub</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Zenhub administration</h2>\n<p> If you are a Zenhub administrator, you can use the following steps to approve license requests:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"https://app.zenhub.com/dashboard/o/department-of-veterans-affairs/manage\">https://app.zenhub.com/dashboard/o/department-of-veterans-affairs/manage</a></li>\n<li>Hit \"assign all\"</li>\n<li>Follow the additional 1-2 steps to \"purchase\" the licenses</li>\n</ol>\n<p> Note: this will make you feel nervous because it seems like you're shelling out money for something. But you're not. We have a forever unlimited free licenses setup with ZenHub. So, though it feels like you're spending money, the card on file will not be charged for the additional licenses.</p>","source":"va.gov-team","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/zenhub.md","title":"Zenhub"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864"]}
