Instead, you can use your PIV to access the Citrix Access Gateway (CAG) site and launch a Windows virtual desktop. This virtual desktop is suitable for checking VA email and accessing VA intranet sites; it's not usable for design or development tasks. </p>\n<p>_These steps are geared towards contractors, specifically Ad Hoc and its subcontractors - if you work for a different company, administrative steps such as who to contact as your COR may differ.</p>\n<h1>Accessing Citrix Access Gateway (CAG)</h1>\n<h2>Requirements:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Your PIV Card</li>\n<li>Your PIV PIN</li>\n<li>CAG access enabled (you have to request this, current POC is: <a href=\"mailto:trista@adhocteam.us\">Trista Coyne</a>.)</li>\n<li>\n<p>A SmartCard reader - you plug this into your USB port and then insert your PIV card into it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One popular option: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RPNZ3BG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RPNZ3BG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Possibly a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D6JPLNQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1\">USB-C to USB Adapter</a> if your laptop does not have a regular USB port.</li>\n<li>This software bundle, installed on your Mac laptop: <a href=\"https://adhoc.slack.com/archives/C15P6TD45/p1521225818000256\">https://adhoc.slack.com/archives/C15P6TD45/p1521225818000256</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: If you do have a VA-issued laptop, you can also use CAG, but the Citrix software should be pre-installed so you should not need to install the above software bundle, and doing so may conflict with the already-installed software.</em></p>\n<h2>Account Requirements:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Contractors must be authorized for CAG access by their Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), and then VA IT staff needs to enable your account for CAG access.

Click from the empty \"Applications\" tab to the \"Desktops\" tab. Different users see different lists of available desktops here depending on how their account is configured, but in general most should be some variant of Windows and should have Outlook and one or more browsers. Find an option that works well enough, isn't super-slow, and has the tools you need installed.</li>\n<li>When you pick a desktop, it will launch and should show a Windows sign-in screen. If it's prompting for a username/password, select \"Log in as a different user\" and then click the SmartCard option. After a few seconds it should read your PIV and prompt you for a PIN, and then log you into Windows.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Linux (Ubuntu 20.04)</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Follow steps 1-3 above</li>\n<li>\n<p>Install OpenSC</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt install opensc\n</code></pre>\n<p>Confirm your card reader is detected</p>\n<pre><code>opensc-tool -l\n# Detected readers (pcsc)\nNr.
