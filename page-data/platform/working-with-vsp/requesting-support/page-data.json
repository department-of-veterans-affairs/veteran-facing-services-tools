If you need assistance from someone on VSP, please post your question or request in the #vfs-platform-support Slack channel. </p>\n<p>VSP’s goal is to answer your questions as soon as possible, but if you aren’t getting traction with your request, we have the following escalation path: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you don't get a response within a few hours, @-mention someone from VSP you know in the channel to look at your question. They can then direct the correct person to answer your question if it isn’t them. </li>\n<li>If you don't get a response within 1 business day, contact your DSVA Product Manager, who will make sure the right people address your question.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We understand the desire to DM someone you’ve worked with previously about a question, but VSP has weekly and biweekly support rotation to limit interruptions for everyone on the platform. </p>\n<h2>Engineering Support</h2>\n<p>For engineering support, please post your question in #vfs-platform-support. If you know that you need specific support from Backend, Frontend, or Ops, you can <code>@mention</code> the developer for that team's current support rotation.</p>\n<p>The current support rotation developer is listed in the channel's description.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/769353/78387128-a8271f80-7593-11ea-87f1-f5ac05f3f15c.png\"></p>\n<p>Please do not DM an engineer that you have worked with previously when you have questions but instead post them in the #vfs-platform-support channel. </p>","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/requesting-support.md","title":"Requesting Support"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864","4193446859","4277382034"]}
