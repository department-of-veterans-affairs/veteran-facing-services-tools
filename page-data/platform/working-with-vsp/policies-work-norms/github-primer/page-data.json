To create the folder, you'll create a README.md file first and tell it that it lives inside the \"mynewfolder\" folder.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the \"superbigfolder\" folder.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Create new file</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the name field, type\n<code>mynewfolder/README.md</code>.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add some content using <a href=\"https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/\">Markdown</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can later delete this file if you don't need it (or you can modify it).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>To save the file and create the new folder, scroll to the bottom of the screen to start <a href=\"#create-a-pull-request\">creating a pull request</a>.</li>\n<li>When the pull request is merged for you, you'll see the README file inside the new \"mynewfolder\" folder.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Delete a file</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the file you want to delete.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>trash can icon</strong></li>\n<li>To delete the file, scroll to the bottom of the screen to start <a href=\"#create-a-pull-request\">creating a pull request</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Delete a folder</h3>\n<p>To delete a folder, you first need to delete all the documents in it. Once you do that, the folder will disappear.</p>\n<p>If you have to create a pull request for each file you want to delete, this could take a lot of time. It's easier to delete a folder and its contents via the command line. Ask a teammate for help using the command line.</p>\n<h3>Create a pull request</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Create, edit, upload, or delete a file.</li>\n<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen to start creating a pull request.</li>\n<li>Note that Github has automatically created a new branch name for you, e.g., <code>ehuntdsva-patch-3</code>.</li>\n<li>Add a title and (optional) comment to describe your change.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Propose file change</strong>.</li>\n<li>Make sure you're comparing the master branch to your new branch. If it says you're comparing master to master or your branch to your branch, select the master branch from the 1st dropdown and the new branch Github created from the 2nd dropdown.</li>\n<li>If the changes look good, click <strong>Create pull request</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Create pull request</strong> again.</li>\n<li>Assign someone to review your pull request. Choice of reviewer depends on what you're trying to do. If you're not sure, ask a teammate.</li>\n<li>Github will check that the file can be merged (has no conflicts) and then notifies your reviewer.</li>\n<li>When your reviewer receives the Github notification, they'll accept your pull request.</li>\n<li>\n<p>After that, if you return to your pull request, it will show that it's been merged.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The pull request screen will ask if you want to delete the pull request branch. Do it - it's no longer needed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Notes</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DSVA team members, DSVA detailees, and Internal contractors have <em>the ability to save directly to the master branch.</em></li>\n<li>To avoid potential conflicts with other people editing the same file, we recommend you create a pull request instead of saving directly to master.</li>\n<li>When the pull request tells you there are no conflicts, you can merge it yourself without asking for a reviewer.</li>\n</ul>","source":"va.gov-team","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/policies-work-norms/github-primer.md","title":"Github Primer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864","68798663"]}
