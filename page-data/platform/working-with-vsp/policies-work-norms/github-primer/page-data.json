It's easier to delete a folder and its contents via the command line.

If it says you're comparing main to main or your branch to your branch, select the main branch from the 1st dropdown and the new branch Github created from the 2nd dropdown.</li>\n<li>If the changes look good, click <strong>Create pull request</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Create pull request</strong> again.</li>\n<li>Assign someone to review your pull request. Choice of reviewer depends on what you're trying to do. If you're not sure, ask a teammate.</li>\n<li>Github will check that the file can be merged (has no conflicts) and then notifies your reviewer.</li>\n<li>When your reviewer receives the Github notification, they'll accept your pull request.</li>\n<li>\n<p>After that, if you return to your pull request, it will show that it's been merged.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The pull request screen will ask if you want to delete the pull request branch. Do it - it's no longer needed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Notes</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DSVA team members, DSVA detailees, and Internal contractors have <em>the ability to save directly to the main branch.</em></li>\n<li>To avoid potential conflicts with other people editing the same file, we recommend you create a pull request instead of saving directly to main.</li>\n<li>When the pull request tells you there are no conflicts, you can merge it yourself without asking for a reviewer.</li>\n</ul>","source":"va.gov-team","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/policies-work-norms/github-primer.md","title":"We've moved our docs!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864"]}
