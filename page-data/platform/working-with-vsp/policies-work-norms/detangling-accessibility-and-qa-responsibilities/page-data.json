This is largely because we've taken a highly collaborative approach across Platform and VFS accessibility and QA experts to develop process, share workload, and enforce standards. At this point however, the volume of concurrent VFS initiatives is making it such that this organic \"blobby\" model is creating too much confusion and slow-down. So! We've worked in recent weeks to better define standards, and clarify what the different responsibilities are for Platform experts, and for VFS teams and now itâ€™s time to start aligning to those responsibilities, by detangling VFS accessibility and QA folks from DEPO Platform process, and creating leaner process for the DEPO Platform accessibility and QA folks.</p>\n<h2>Action plan</h2>\n<h3>Accessibility</h3>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<p><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Publish clear standards that the DEPO Platform will enforce</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" checked disabled> Update existing docs</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Publicize (ToTs)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<p><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Clearly separate out guidance content from requirements content in the documentation</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Update docs, and share in ToT, so it's clear that VFS teams need to come to the staging review w/their testing and artifacts complete, and the specifics of tasks that fall on VFS, VFS w/SME, vs VSP</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Update docs so it's easy for VFS teams to follow the steps necessary to do their required testing and artifacts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Create automated dashboard of outstanding 508 issues</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<p><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Remove VFS personnel from governance/enforcement activities and Slack channels</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Brief all parties that VSP will deliver feedback in review meetings</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Brief all parties that VSP may change the severity of an issue based on our review, and that'll be communicated to the VFS team members as a part of the staging review.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<p><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Remove DEPO Platfrom personnel from VFS-specific activities</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Brief all parties that VFS teams need to alert the VA 508 Office (w/VSP cc'd) once they've launched</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Do <a href=\"https://app.mural.co/t/vspproduct9990/m/vspproduct9990/1602273732125/413b2daecfe8e7bccdce52af12ecf518e1f5a695\">DEPO Platform workflow evaluation</a> and cut / adjust steps where possible so the workflow is more manageable</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>QA</h3>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Publish clear standards that the DEPO Platform will enforce</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Clearly separate out guidance content from requirements content in the documentation</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Update docs, and share in ToT, so it's clear that VFS teams need to come to the staging review w/their testing and artifacts complete</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Update docs so it's easy for VFS teams to follow the steps necessary to do their testing and artifacts</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Remove VFS personnel from governance/enforcement activities and Slack channels </li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Remove DEPO Platfrom personnel from VFS-specific meetings (if there are any)</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Do DEPO Platform workflow evaluation and cut / adjust steps where possible so the workflow is more manageable</li>\n</ul>","source":"va.gov-team","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/policies-work-norms/detangling-accessibility-and-qa-responsibilities.md","title":"Detangling Accessibility and QA Responsibilities"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864","68798663"]}
