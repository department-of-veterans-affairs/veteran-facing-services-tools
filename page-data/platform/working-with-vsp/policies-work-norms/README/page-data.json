It's divided into \"repositories\" (or \"repos\") which are groups of related files or documents. For example, this file lives in the <code>va.gov-vfs-teams</code> repo.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You can use Github by visiting the URL for a specific repo in your browser and editing files from there. Or you can use the command line to interact with files.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you're not familiar with Github, use the web URL to learn how Github works and what you can do with it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For non-developers, most Github work happens in the <code>va.gov-team</code> repo where they store and share files.</li>\n<li>Github makes it easy to \"style\" text-based documents using Markdown syntax. Learn how to use <a href=\"https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/\">Github Flavored Markdown</a>.</li>\n<li>Review the <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/policies-work-norms/github-primer.md\">Github primer to learn how to do basic tasks like creating a file or submitting a pull request</a>.</li>\n<li>See also <a href=\"#tips-for-managing-files-and-folders\">tips for managing Github files and folders</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Tips for managing files and folders</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Always use a dash (-) between words in file and folder names.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a folder (or a file) name has white space in it, Github fills each white space with <code>%20</code>. </li>\n<li>This makes it hard for people to read Github URLs and even harder to type them (e.g., if you're on your mobile device).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use meaningful descriptive titles for files (and folders).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give files (and folders) descriptive names to help people understand what's in them <strong>before they click into them</strong>.</li>\n<li>Avoid acronyms in titles. Characters are cheap. Use them!</li>\n<li>Descriptive titles make it much easier to find things using Github's Search function.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Include a useful README.md file at the root of your folder structure, e.g., inside your \"Product/Design\" folder.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Useful READMEs tell people what's in the sub-folders and files <strong>before they click into them</strong>.</li>\n<li>Consider a TOC approach.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use a predictable folder structure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow examples set by people/teams who came before you. Browse around in <code>va.gov-team</code> repo to see what other teams have done.</li>\n<li>Don't make a bunch of sub-folders that each only contain a few files. This makes it much harder for people to find things.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When a folder contains 12 or more files, start thinking about grouping files into sub-folders to make it easier for people to find stuff.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Managing agile workflow</h3>\n<p>Each Github repo has a section called \"Issues.\" <a href=\"https://guides.github.com/features/issues/\">Learn about issues</a>.</p>\n<p>We use <a href=\"https://www.zenhub.com\">Zenhub</a> with Github to turn the \"Issues\" section into an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)\">scrum board</a>.</p>\n<p>The \"Issues\" section of the <code>va.gov-team</code> repo is where all teams manage their Epics, User Stories, and agile workflow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Additional details on Zenhub are <a href=\"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/zenhub.md\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Get help with Github</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>If you have problems using Github, <a href=\"../../faqs.md#github\">check the Github FAQs for potential solutions</a>.</li>\n<li>Ask in a Slack channel.</li>\n</ol>","source":"va.gov-team","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/policies-work-norms/README.md","title":"We've moved our docs!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864"]}
