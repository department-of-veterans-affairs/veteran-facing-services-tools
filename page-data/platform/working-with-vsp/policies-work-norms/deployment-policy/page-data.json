The release is created from <code>master</code> at 2 pm Eastern and deployed at 3 pm Eastern. Code merged to <code>master</code> after 2 pm Eastern will not be added to a release and deployed until the next business day.</p>\n<h2>Exceptions to automated deploys</h2>\n<p>If there are days or periods of time when many people will be out of the office (i.e. holidays) the automated deploys will be suspended. If people aren’t in the office to support the code going out, it’s not responsible to release.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This only applies to <em>automated</em> deploys.
