This is the same as turning on Do Not Disturb.</p>\n<h3>Hide the Dock</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I hide it all the time, but it helps reduce screen clutter and focus your audience on the UI at hand.</li>\n<li>Consider moving the dock \"position on screen\" to the left (as opposed to the bottom) if someone is going to be controlling your prototype remotely and frequently moving the mouse to the bottom, which would reveal the dock</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Adjust browser view</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hide the browser bookmark bar. <code>CMD-SHFT-B</code>  toggles the bookmark bar.</li>\n<li>If you want to show mobile views of a live form, better to use the inspector device mode that can easily hit device breakpoints. <code>OPT-CMD-I</code> opens the inspector.</li>\n<li>There is also a Mac app called <a href=\"https://manytricks.com/desktopcurtain/\">Desktop Curtain ($5)</a> that will put a fake desktop in front of the pile of messy screen caps on your actual desktop.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Show scroll bars</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For usability testing on Mac OS, you'll want to make sure <a href=\"https://heresthethingblog.com/2015/03/10/mac-tip-macs-scroll-bars/\">scroll bars are set to be visible</a> so that participants can use them in case scroll wheel and trackpad actions don't come through the conference software (sometimes they don't). By default, they are set to show only when there's a mouse plugged in.</li>\n<li>Open the System Preferences app</li>\n<li>Go to \"general\"</li>\n<li>Under \"show scroll bars\", choose \"always\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Showing something in Sketch?</h3>\n<p><code>⌘-.</code> (command-period) will toggle the layer and inspector rails in Sketch so you are only looking at the artboards. This reduces distraction and makes better use of valuable screen real estate.</p>\n<h3>Set up conference software</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you use a second display with a laptop, share the laptop screen. It will not need to be scaled as much and this will make it more legible for any viewers.</li>\n<li>Turn off the <em>bee-boop</em> when a new person joins. In GoToMeeting it is an option in a dropdown in the audio panel of the conference UI.</li>\n<li>If you have a lot of observers, try to get people to watch together to reduce the appearance of a large audience.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Audio quality</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Test out your audio set-up beforehand and address any problems prior to your first live session. </li>\n<li>Avoid an echoey rooms. Curtains or blankets can help reduce echo.</li>\n<li>Encourage noisy pets to be elsewhere during your session.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Easy muting</h3>\n<p>Consider a utility that will let you mute / unmute with a key command in case you need to cough or mute some ambient noise. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://mizage.com/shush/\">Shush ($5)</a> for Mac is a good one, though it requires <a href=\"https://mizage.clarify-it.com/d/g9hh9m\">this workaround for GoToMeeting</a>, otherwise it can add static sounds on the line.</li>\n<li>If you do this a lot, a headset with an easy hardware mute is a good quality of life improvement.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Disable autofill form fields</h3>\n<p>Especially if you are testing a live prototype or website, turn off the browser setting that autocompletes form fields so that your participants can enter their own information without being prompted to use yours.</p>\n<h2>Stakeholder walkthrough of a form or flow</h2>\n<p><em>All of the above</em></p>\n<p>If your form will allow moving backwards and forwards, it’s nice to prefill all the fields (high five Chris Valarida) so that people don’t have to watch you type. It means you can quickly move through the uncontroversial stuff and spend more time on tricky details.</p>\n<h2>Demo videos</h2>\n<p>We often record walktrough videos for use by the contact centers to train staff on changes or new features. These are typically \"internal use\", but you never know if it might have a wider audience. </p>\n<p><em>All of the above</em></p>\n<h2>Window resize</h2>\n<p>Picking a window size will help you maintain consistency in video aspect ratio. This can also help with documentation that includes screenshots. <a href=\"https://manytricks.com/moom/\">Moom</a>’s custom grid feature to do it to avoid having to vet another browser extention for trustworthiness.</p>\n<p>It might be worth considering finding a common size that will work for all authors.</p>","source":"va.gov-team","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/policies-work-norms/sharing-your-screen.md","title":"We've moved our docs!"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864"]}
