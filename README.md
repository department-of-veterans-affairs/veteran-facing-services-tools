# Veteran Facing Services tools

This repo contains front end code and documentation used by the Veteran facing services on VA.gov. It's a monorepo managed by Lerna, a tool for managing versioning and publishing for multiple modules located in a single repo.

There is [another repository for the documentation site](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation). The documentation site can be viewed at [design.va.gov](https://design.va.gov). See also: [contributing to Formation](https://design.va.gov/documentation/contributing-to-formation).

## Build

### Troubleshooting

#### `error "gatsby-mdx" threw an error while running the onCreateNode lifecycle`

##### Example error: `unknown: Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <img>`

##### Context

The `documentation` package uses the [`gatsby-source-git` Gatsby plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-git/) to [sync content from the `va.gov-team` repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools/blob/aaae519093b16b6b884e5133a42fee69754f5f74/packages/documentation/gatsby-config.js#L13-L22). 

Unfortunately, invalid HTML in `va.gov-team` Markdown files can break the build of the `veteran-facing-services-tools` repo.

##### Solution 

To fix the `Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <img>` error, you need to do the following:

1. Find the invalid HTML in the `va.gov-team` repo
   1. Look for a string from the error message in the `va.gov-team` repo to find the offending Markdown file
   2. Look for HTML tags in that Markdown file
2. Fix the invalid HTML
   - For example, replace HTML images with markdown images
      ```
      - <img src="zenhub-license-request.png" alt="zenhub license request"></img>
      + ![zenhub license request](zenhub-license-request.png)
      ```
3. Rerun `veteran-facing-services-tools` build
   - Options
     - Rerun the Jenkins job
